- When making pure Perl copies of test files, this plugin now skips
  Dist::Zilla::File::InMemory objects. These are typically added by other
  plugins like Test::EOL or Test::Compile, and there's no usually no point in
  testing them twice. Some plugins (like Test::Compile) are implemented in a
  way that copying the test file ends up generating a broken test, and this
  avoid that problem.

# ABSTRACT: Run all your tests twice, once with XS code and once with pure Perl



=pod

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PurePerlTests - Run all your tests twice, once with XS code and once with pure Perl

=head1 VERSION

version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [PurePerlTests]
  env_var = MY_MODULE_PURE_PERL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is for modules which ship with a dual XS/pure Perl implementation.

The plugin makes a copy of all your tests when doing release testing (via
C<dzil test> or C<dzil release>). The copy will set an environment value that
you specify in a C<BEGIN> block. You can use this to force your code to not
load the XS implementation.

=for Pod::Coverage gather_files

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This plugin takes one configuration key, "env_var", which is required.

=head1 SKIPPING TESTS

If you don't want to run the a given test file in pure Perl mode, you can put
a comment like this in your test:

  # no pp test

This must be on a line by itself. This plugin will skip any tests which
contain this comment.

=head1 SUPPORT

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-dist-zilla-plugin-pureperltests@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web
interface at L<http://rt.cpan.org>. I will be notified, and then you'll
automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

=head1 DONATIONS

If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.

Please note that B<I am not suggesting that you must do this> in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time, which seems unlikely at best.

To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
button on this page: L<http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html>
